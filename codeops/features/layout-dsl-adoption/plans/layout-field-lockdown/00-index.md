# Layout Field Lockdown Implementation Plan

> **Feature**: Give `packages/examples` a real typecheck gate, make `View.layout` a read-only
> field so `setLayout()` is its only writer, and finish the Tier-3 canvas adoption — in that
> order, because each step is the oracle for the next.

## Overview

Three issues that look independent are one dependency chain, and the chain runs in the opposite
direction to their issue numbers.

`View.layout` is a public mutable field. Anything can replace it wholesale — silently dropping
every prop it omits and never reflowing — or mutate its `rect` in place. `setLayout()` exists to be
the safe writer, but nothing enforces it. #117-P4 closes that hole.

The obstacle is not the conversion. It is that **the compiler cannot see most of the code that
would break**. `packages/examples/tsconfig.json` names six directories; 148 of its 255 `.ts` files
never typecheck, and 56 write sites hide there. So #132 comes first — not for hygiene, but because
it is the instrument the rest of the plan measures with.

#129 comes last for the same reason inverted: its canvases are largely inside that blind spot, and
its work is per-file *design* rather than mechanical substitution, so it wants both the compiler and
a render control behind it.

The blind spot turned out to be far wider than one package. **No package except `datagrid`
typechecks its tests** — 743 test files, 395 of them `*.spec.test.ts` oracles, holding **703**
further write sites. Because `readonly` is erased at runtime and vitest never typechecks, a
lockdown scoped to `src/` would have passed every acceptance check while enforcing nothing in 254
test files (AR-13). `datagrid` already carries the fix worth copying (AR-14).

| Phase | Issue | What it does | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | #132 + the repo-wide gap | Turn on typechecking for `examples` and every `test/`; clear the errors it exposes | 206 errors / ~121 files |
| 2 | #117-P4 | Convert every write to `setLayout()`, then flip the field read-only | 816 sites / 313 files |
| 3 | #129 | Tier-3 canvas adoption + retire 5 name shadows | 18 sites + 5 shadows |

## The finding that shaped this plan

The counts here were not derived by reading code. The field was flipped to `readonly` in a spike,
`ui` was rebuilt so downstream packages saw the new `.d.ts`, and `tsc --noEmit` ran per package;
the tree was then restored. That mattered, because three separate traps each produce a
confidently wrong answer:

1. **`readonly` is shallow.** `readonly LayoutProps` and `readonly Readonly<LayoutProps>` both
   reported *exactly 21 errors* — adding `Readonly<>` appeared to change nothing.
2. **Ten subclasses silently re-open the field.** `override layout: LayoutProps` without
   `readonly` restores write access with no diagnostic. Closing those hatches took the count from
   21 to 31 and revealed every in-place `rect` mutation.
3. **Turbo halts at the first failing package**, and downstream packages typecheck against
   `ui/dist`, not `ui/src`. Without rebuilding, four packages report zero.

4. **`rootDir` decides whether test typechecking means anything.** Widening `include` while
   `rootDir` is `"src"` emits 606 phantom `TS6059`; omitting `rootDir` makes `ui` report **1**
   error because `TS2209` aborts resolution and hides **80**.

Naive flip: **21 sites**. Truth: **816**. Every miss looks like success — which is the specific
reason Phase 1 exists.
